            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              From February 25-28, 2026, Sacramento will host COMPOST2026—the annual conference of the US Composting Council.
              Over 3,000 composters, researchers, and policymakers will converge to discuss one thing:

              <p className="text-green-800">
                For decades, compost was treated as a byproduct—something to do with yard waste and food scraps.
                Now, it's biological infrastructure. The USDA is betting $700M on regenerative practices, and
                compost is at the center.

              In 2025, the USDA launched its most ambitious regenerative agriculture initiative to date:

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This isn't a grant program. It's a recognition that the USDA's traditional "more inputs = more yield"

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Why is the USDA prioritizing compost over synthetic fertilizers? Three reasons:

                <h3 className="font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Carbon Sequestration</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Compost locks carbon into soil for decades. Synthetic fertilizers release CO2. Every ton of compost
                  applied removes approximately 0.5 tons of CO2 equivalent from the atmosphere.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Compost delivers billions of beneficial microorganisms. These microbes rebuild the soil food web,
                  making nutrients bioavailable and suppressing disease.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  In drought-prone regions like Arizona, compost's ability to increase water-holding capacity by
                  20,000+ gallons per acre per inch applied is game-changing.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You don't apply compost to feed plants. You apply it to rebuild the soil ecosystem that feeds plants
              for you. Once that ecosystem is healthy, your fertilizer costs drop by 30-50% because the soil does
              the work synthetic inputs used to do.

              This is why the USDA is investing $700M. Regenerative farming isn't idealism. It's economics.
